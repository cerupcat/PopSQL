				h1 What #{title} is not!

			div.col 
				p #{title} is not a traditional search engine. It's purpose is to fetch results that fit into the natural flow of a chat interface. This is an important note, because the power of #{title} is the ability to interface with data casually.  
			div.col 
				p #{title} is not a new query language. It's a javascript framework that translates and fascilitates between natural text based conversations and queries. By using a finite environment like chat and including additional finite parameters (ie. 140 character limit), we can pattern match tokens, vocabulary and argument structure with a higher level of accuracy.
